# MATLAB Folder

This folder contains the files and data necessary for the MATLAB implementation and analysis.

## Directory Contents

- **Implementation**: This folder contains the MATLAB implementation files used for processing, analysing, and visualising the data obtained from the simulations.
- **Measurements**: This folder includes the measurement data generated from Wireless InSite simulations, which serve as input for the MATLAB implementation.

Ensure all files are retained within their respective directories to maintain the functionality of the MATLAB scripts.

## Additional Information

- Please ensure you have the necessary version of MATLAB installed to run the simulations. Our simulations were conducted using MATLAB R2023b. For more information about the software, including installation instructions and features, visit the [MATLAB](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) website.
