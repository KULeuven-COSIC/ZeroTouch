# Implementation

This folder contains MATLAB scripts used for processing, analysing, and visualising simulation data, as well as implementing machine learning models.

## Script Descriptions

- **draw_figure2.m** and **draw_figure3.m**: These scripts generate figures of the apartment, including anchor nodes and results derived from the simulations.
- **plot_rooms.m**: This script visualises the apartment layout.
- **load_measurements.m**: Loads RSS measurements obtained from Wireless InSite simulations for further processing.
- **neural_network_autoencoder_anomaly_detection_final.m**: Implements the final autoencoder for anomaly detection.
- **neural_network_perceptron.m**: Implements the final supervised learning model using a perceptron.

Ensure all required input files, such as the measurements, are correctly loaded to ensure proper functionality of the scripts.
