# Directory Structure

This repository is organized into subdirectories, each dedicated to a specific type of simulation or experiment using Wireless InSite.

## Subdirectories Overview

1. **Additional Figures**: Contains supplementary figures produced from our simulations, offering additional insights and visualisations.

2. **Apartment model**: Includes the CAD models of the apartment used as the simulation environment.

3. **Inside transmitters**: Stores simulation files specifically for transmitters located within the apartment.

4. **Outside transmitters**: Contains simulation files for transmitters positioned outside the apartment.

## Additional Information

- Please ensure you have the necessary version of Wireless InSite installed to run the simulations. Our simulations were conducted using Wireless InSite version 3.4.4.
