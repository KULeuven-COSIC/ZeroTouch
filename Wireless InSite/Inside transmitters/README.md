# Inside Transmitters

This folder contains simulation files for transmitters positioned inside the apartment. These simulations examine wireless propagation for outdoor transmitter scenarios.

## Running the Simulation

To begin the simulation process, open the `Simulation.setup` file. This action will launch the Wireless InSite software with the pre-configured settings for the outdoor simulation scenario. Once the software is open, the simulation can be initiated from within the Wireless InSite interface.

## Directory Contents

This directory contains the following:

- **Configuration and Wireless InSite-Generated Files**: Files that are essential for defining and executing the simulations. These include configuration files detailing the simulation environment, antenna characteristics, and other critical variables. Additionally, this folder contains files generated by Wireless InSite during the simulation process, encompassing both setup configurations and output data.
- **Log Files**: Generated during the simulation runs, these files provide detailed logs of the simulation process.

## Output Data

The output data for these simulations is stored in the `Simulation 1` folder. However, due to size constraints, the data has not been included in this directory. It can be downloaded [here](https://mega.nz/folder/xxclXYiR#Do4h264nC4XnJwbCjHicMA).

## Note

It is essential to keep all files in this directory intact to ensure the simulations run smoothly. Deleting or modifying certain files may result in simulation errors or inaccurate results.
