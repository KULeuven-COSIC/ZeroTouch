# Outside Transmitters

This folder contains simulation files for transmitters positioned outside the apartment. These simulations examine wireless propagation for outdoor transmitter scenarios.

## Running the Simulation

To begin the simulation process, open the `InSide.setup` file. This action will launch the Wireless InSite software with the pre-configured settings for the indoor simulation scenario. Once the software is open, you can proceed to run the simulation from within the Wireless InSite interface.

## Directory Contents

Apart from the `InSide.setup` file, this directory contains a variety of other files, including:

- **Configuration and Wireless InSite-Generated Files**: Files that are essential for defining and running the simulations. It contains configuration files with settings and parameters that outline the simulation environment, antenna characteristics, and other critical variables. Additionally, it houses files created by Wireless InSite during the simulation process, encompassing both setup configurations and output data.
- **Log Files**: Generated during simulation runs, these files provide detailed logs of the simulation process.

## Note

It's important to keep all files in this directory intact to ensure the simulation runs smoothly. Deleting or modifying certain files may result in simulation errors or inaccurate results.
